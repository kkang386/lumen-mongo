## Problem statement


Design and implement a program that keeps track of people's birthdays

and warns about upcoming birthdays. If their birthday is today,

the program should warn about the number of hours remaining until the

end of a person's birthday, otherwise it should warn about the number

of months/days left until their next birthday.


The program should be implemented as a JSON REST service in Lumen,

using MongoDB as database, storing the following minimum information

about a person:


- Name

- Birth date (validated on input)

- Time zone (their local, validated on input)


At least two HTTP endpoints should be implemented:


- Create a new Person and persist it in the database

- List all Persons in the database with their upcoming birthdays.


Include a human readable message with details about upcoming birthday, such as:


    "Ken Thompson is 78 years old in 10 months, 29 days in America/New_York"


or


    "Ken Thompson is 78 years old today (7 hours remaining in America/New_York)"


### Notes on design


The engine should support calculating intervals from the current time,

or from a user-specified time. The latter should be used in unit

tests that should also be provided (using PHPUnit).


#### Features outside of the project scope (don't need to be implemented)


- It is not necessary to have endpoints for deleting and modifying

Person records

- It is not necessary to enforce uniqueness of Person records

- It is not necessary to support localization (language/time format/etc.)

- It is not necessary to seed the database


#### Example query and response


    $ curl -s http://localhost:8000/person/ | jq .

    {

      "data": [

        {

          "name": "Ken Thompson",

          "birthdate": "1943-02-04",

          "timezone": "America/New_York",

          "isBirthday": false,

          "interval": {

            "y": 0,

            "m": 10,

            "d": 29,

            "h": 10,

            "i": 49,

            "s": 47,

            "_comment": "possibly other fields..."

          },

          "message": "Ken Thompson is 78 years old in 10 months, 29 days in America/New_York"

        },
